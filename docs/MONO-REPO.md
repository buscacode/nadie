# Mono repo

npm init --scope @nadie --workspace ./packages/utils -y

## build
in a  root directory 

npm run build --workspace ./packages/utils


## use one utility into another 

Now, letâ€™s assume you want to use some utility functions from the @monorepo/utils in the @monorepo/tools package. All you have to do is run the following npm command in the root directory:

npm install @nadie/utils --workspace ./packages/tools
